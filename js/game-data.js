DEAR FRIEND,

I hope this letter meets you in good health. I am Prince Ibrahim Mohammed, the son of late General Mohammed who was recently killed in a plane crash. Before his death, my father deposited the sum of US$30,000,000 (Thirty Million United States Dollars) in a security company.

I need your assistance to transfer this money to your country as I cannot do it alone due to my political situation here in Nigeria. I will give you 30% of the total sum for your assistance.

All I need from you is:
1. Your full name and address
2. Your telephone and fax numbers  
3. A copy of your international passport
4. Your bank account details

This transaction is 100% risk-free and legal. I have all the necessary documents to prove the legitimacy of this money.

Please reply urgently as time is running out.
